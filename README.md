🚀 Machine Learning & Deep Learning Projects
Welcome to this repository! Here, we have implemented three exciting projects covering different domains of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing (NLP). These projects aim to provide hands-on experience with real-world data, enabling us to build robust predictive models using various techniques.

We are immensely grateful to Coding Samurai for this wonderful opportunity to learn, implement, and grow in the field of AI & ML. Their guidance and mentorship have been instrumental in shaping these projects.

We also welcome contributions and improvements from the open-source community! Feel free to explore, suggest enhancements, or contribute to make these projects even better. 🚀

📌 Project 1: House Price Prediction using Linear Regression
📝 Description:
This project builds a house price prediction model using Linear Regression with L1 Regularization (Lasso). The dataset includes features such as:
🏠 Area (calculated as Length × Width)
🌤 Weather Conditions
🏗 Age of House
📍 Location Features

Using these, the model learns to predict house prices based on given attributes, optimizing its performance through feature engineering and regularization techniques.

🔹 Key Features:
✅ Feature Engineering – Derived new features like area = length × width
✅ L1 Regularization (Lasso) – Helps in feature selection and reduces overfitting
✅ Synthetic Dataset – Created a custom dataset for experimentation
✅ Performance Evaluation – Used MSE (Mean Squared Error) for accuracy measurement

📌 Project 2: Sentiment Analysis on Tweets (NLP)
📝 Description:
This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify tweets as Positive, Negative, or Neutral. Using synthetically generated text data, we train a machine learning model to analyze sentiment based on user input.

🔹 Key Features:
✅ Text Preprocessing – Tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization
✅ TF-IDF & Word Embeddings – Feature extraction from textual data
✅ Supervised Learning Model – Used Logistic Regression/SVM for classification
✅ Interactive Prediction – Takes user input and classifies sentiment

📌 Project 3: Image Classification Using Transfer Learning
📝 Description:
This project uses Transfer Learning with ResNet50 to classify images from the Flowers Dataset. Instead of training a deep neural network from scratch, we fine-tune a pre-trained ResNet50 model and adapt it for our dataset.

🔹 Key Features:
✅ Pre-trained ResNet50 Model – Efficient feature extraction
✅ Custom Dense Layers – Added layers to improve classification performance
✅ Performance Visualization – Accuracy and loss plots for better insights
✅ Real-Time Prediction – Uses OpenCV to classify new images
